Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a student of Frontend, Data Science, and Game Development. On this profile, I share my projects, challenges, and learnings in these areas with the goal of evolving and contributing to the developer community. ðŸš€

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on improving my skills with JavaScript, Python, and Machine Learning, as well as exploring game development with Unity. If youâ€™re interested in any of these areas or want to exchange ideas, feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜‰
